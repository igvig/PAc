Finding the best values for these parameters is a simple optimization problem.  Given resource constraints, it is likely that one would start from an array size $n$ and look for optimal array bounds to match that array size.  While it should be possible to derive a closed form equation of this error $\\varepsilon$ for any given closed form activation $a(x)$, a computational approach may yield more automated results. This is the approach taken here.\n","\n","Multiple optimization goals could be aimed for. The present work aims for two different goals: (a) minimizing the maximum point error $\\varepsilon(x)$ so that the deviation from actual activation is localized to a particular set of trigger values, and (b) minimizing the absolute area under the curve of $\\varepsilon(x)$ to ensure the overall faithfulness of the approximation $\\tilde{a}(x)$ to its activation $a(x)$.  Given the scale difference between the two goals and the lack of an objective preference or weights of the two, the product of these will be used as the objective function to minimize.  In other words, the problem can be stated as finding\n","$$\n","\\min \\left(\\varepsilon_\\text{max}\\times AUC\\right)\n","$$\n","\n","-----\n","\n","The total $AUC$ of a pre-computed activation
